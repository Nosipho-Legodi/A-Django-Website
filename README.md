# A-Django-Website
This website is one that helps the user know about the course offered at the University of Zululand. 

This website consists of two parts. One where the user can can search for the career or course that they want and the website will return information about that course. 

The other part is where the student picks the subject they did and the marks that they got for that subject, then the website returns the courses that the user qualifies for, however this part is still a work in progess.

I have been working on the CRUD part of this project because since i used Django and Django comes with it's own built in "CRUD" system I did not see the need to create one but i have decided to add one.

This website is still a work in progress, some guidance would be highly appreciated.
